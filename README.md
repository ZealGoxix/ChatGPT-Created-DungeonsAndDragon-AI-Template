# Project Overview

All credit goes to ChatGPT. This template is kept for learning purposes and possible future projects. Starting my serach for the perfect D&D AI for solo play, I could not find any. D&D AI could never meet the real-life expectations, experience, or role play of having a Dungeon Master. If I could make the reality one step closer even with the current errors, I want to try.

## How to Run the Project
Requirements: ChatGPT AI, Python

Run in Command Line.
```cmd
py dnd_ai.py
```
#Inspiration

* **AI Dungeon** - A text-based adventure-story game you direct (and star in) while the AI brings it to life.

## Future Ideas
* **Character Intergration**
* **Turn-Based Combat**
* **AI Training For Better Campaign**
* **Chat-GPT-Generated Passive&Abilites Randomsier For RPG-Like Gameplay**
